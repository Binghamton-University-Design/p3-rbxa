				<h1>WHY DOES THIS PAGE EXIST?</h1>
				<p-yellow>As a student at BU for four years, I'd fallen in love with the sunsets in this area. I loved finding new views and taking spontaneous wrong turns to try to get a good vantage point as the sky began changing colors.</p-yellow>
				<div class="spacer-10"></div>
				<p-pink>I made this page for fun as part of a class, because I would love if other people could find as much peace and wonder as I do in watching the sunsets in Binghamton.</p-pink>
				<div class="spacer-10"></div>
				<p-pink>If there's a place you love to go in Binghamton to watch the sunset that I haven't described, please reach out to me at rcolao.design@gmail.com, I'd love to learn about it.</p-pink>

				<h1>A SHORT STORY</h1>
				<h2>The legend of Sunsets of Binghamton.</h2>
				<div class="spacer-20"></div>
				<p-pink>Long ago, Fog crept in slowly through the night on a long journey through the valley, lying in the Hills to rest. However, Sun suddenly rose from behind the Hills and drove Fog away in fear, where she disappeared into the Hills. Sun did not see that Fog had disguised herself, hiding on blades of grass and forest plants as dew.</p-pink>
				<div class="spacer-10"></div>
				<p-orange>Sun rose in triumph over the valley, lifting himself higher and higher. All day Fog whispered to the Hills, begging the Hills to pull Sun back down so Fog can continue on her way and pass through the valley without burning. The Hills whispered to the twin Rivers, and they agreed to help.</p-orange>
				<div class="spacer-10"></div>
				<p-pink>The twins cast their lines and missed once, twice. The third time the Rivers' hook caught the very edge of the Sun, so slightly that Sun does not notice his capture. At midday, Sun became weary of climbing and rested, looking up at the sky. Rivers continued to reel in Sun ever so slowly. Closer, closer, lower, lower, so Sun did not notice for many hours as he rested.</p-pink>
				<div class="spacer-10"></div>
				<p-yellow>After many hours, the Hills grew worried, because they no longer saw dew on the plants. They told the Rivers to hurry, before Fog disappeared forever. The twins reeled faster. However, it was not long before Sun rolled over and saw how close he was to the valley below. He tried to push himself up, but to no avail - Rivers' lines were strong. He pushed and pulled, struggling against the twins. The hooks tore at his sides, and Sun's glow leaked out across the sky, turning orange, pink and red as he fought the Rivers harder and harder.</p-yellow>
				<div class="spacer-10"></div>
				<p-orange>Finally, in one last burst of angry color from Sun, the Rivers pulled Sun beyond the Hills. Cool darkness began to fill the air, and the Rivers and Hills rejoiced. They invited Fog to come out, for Sun had fled the valley. But Fog had grown so weak from a full day of Sun. She needed several hours to gather herself and draw herself out from the forest. Just when the Hills and Rivers had begun to lose hope, Fog rose out of the forest and sailed across the valley. She embraced the Rivers and Hills in gratitude and passed safely beyond the valley to continue her journey in peace.</p-orange>
